Intro to Raster Data in R: 1 hour
Plot Raster Data in R: 1 hour (start 11am)
  Mistake?" The bin intervals are shown using ( to mean inclusive and ] to mean exclusive. For example: (305, 342] means “from 305 through 341”."
  Challenge: Plot Using Custom Breaks - students need hint on new options: ggtitle, xlab, and ylab
  
Reproject Raster Data in R	and Raster Calculations in R: 1 hr 30 min (start 1pm)
 The instructor skimmed over some things and focused on the core
 lines of code. We did the last activity for 30 min over a coffee break
 
Open and Plot Shapefiles in R start 2:30pm end 2:50 pm, spent 20-30 min on activity 
 
 Explore and Plot by Shapefile Attributes start 3:15 pm
  Challenge: Subset Spatial Line Objects Part 1 and Part 2: did challenge
   - 3:30 Start color customization for line type (abbreviated?)
  - 3:43 start Challenge: Plot Polygon by Attribute US data

  4:05 plot multiple vectors on same plot
  4:12 load the chm_HARV and add show example of raster and vector
  4:17 talked about everything
  
  
 
 
 
Alternate timeline:
  Morning 1: Intro to R
 After lunch 1: set up project, dplyr, ggplot (1.5 hr)
 - Intro to spatial stuff (1 hr)
 - start 1st raster lesson (1 hr)
 
 Morning 2: plot raster
 project raster
 raster calculation
 
 Afternoon 2: open shapefile
 plot shapefile and customize
 project shapefile
 (from US map excercise could move straight to Handling Spatial Projection & CRS in R
   and add example of plotting raster and shapefile together)
 using online databases to get shapefile for your field site map
 
 Other thoughts:
   A lot of the challenges could be faster if we provide the code for the students
 to load the files, and provide the functions that they haven't learned before
